The great thing about DIY printables is that you can print as many as you want, however you want!\r\n\r\nPrint from Home - Print onto white cardstock (at least 110lbs recommended). Remember if you print on cardstock other than white, the colours of the design may vary. Your PDF will include cut marks to follow when cutting them out.\r\n\r\nCommercial Printer – You can print the file using places like Staples, Walmart, etc. Save your PDF to your computer and either order prints on their website or bring the file into your local copy shop on a USB flash drive. Again, cut marks are included as required by these commercial printers.\r\n\r\nOnline Options – Sites like Vistaprint.com offer printing BUT they do not allow standard sizes like 5x7 or 4x6. Please let me know if you are using Vistaprint ASAP so I can change the sizing of your file.\r\n\r\n\r\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\r\n▧ PLEASE NOTE ▧\r\n▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬\r\n\r\nPlease note the colour that you see on your monitor may not be the exact same as your printed product. All monitors are different and display colours different. I recommend printing your proof on your home printer first to make sure you are satisfied with the colours.\r\n\r\nItems are strictly for personal (non-commercial) use only.

"title": "Fortunato - Pine, Smoke and Whiskey Solid Scent",
"description": "Fortunato :: Pine, Smoke + Whiskey\r\n\r\nA scent worthy of all great adventurers, Fortunato combines crisp pine with warm notes of whiskey and amber, the deep musk of frank and myrrh, and a hint of campfire smoke. Fortunato truly embodies the gypsy spirit.\r\n\r\nFortunato&#39;s tale is an epic one indeed! We&#39;ll give you the super-condensed version here: Imagine, please, a handsome gypsy fellow from the deep South, with bright blue eyes and dark disheveled hair, washing his filthy face and arms in a horse trough. Imagine further the Madame&#39;s surprise when this forsaken character rushed toward her, dripping horse water, exclaiming incoherently and causing her to drop all of the herbs she had painstakingly spent all morning collecting. It was no wonder she cracked him over the head with one of his own bottles of snake oil.\r\n\r\nWhen Fortunato came to, he found himself significantly sobered and surrounded by various members of the troupe: the Horned Devil Man, the Fiji Mermaid, Morgan the Cloven Lady, who all listened intently to his tale. Fortunato had been employed as a carpenter in the South, more specifically a coffin-maker. He and his partner Santiago had both fallen for the infamously beautiful voodoo queen Marie Laveau, although sadly Fortunato&#39;s love was unrequited. Upon discovering his partner in throes of passion with the lovely queen, Fortunato lost control. (And most of his memory, from the incident.) Soon after, Santiago mysteriously vanished, and Fortunato thought it best that he should disappear too. He left his home to travel the country, peddling elixirs on the side of the road. And so it went, until the day he saw the Madame pocketing herbs.\r\n\r\nAfter hearing his story, Madame still doubted his sanity but agreed to give him work. While unloading the wagons for the next show, he came across a broken accordion. He had heard these instruments in zydeco music back home, and was fascinated by the intricacy of the parts he saw busted before him. The Madame laughed, telling him it was junk. &quot;If you can fix it, you can keep it.&quot; He set to work immediately. Many nights later, he had finally straightened his last piston and taped his last bellow. He took a deep breath, and gave it a squeeze. The sounds that came out of the machine were rich and dull. His fingers glided across the keyboard, every note playing in synch with the last. Never before had he been so thrilled with a project! Madame was quite pleased as well, and this gypsy boy became accompanist for many of the Scodioli performers.\r\n\r\nVery generously sized 1.0 oz. screw-top container.\r\nHand-poured by the Madame herself.\r\nWaterproof label.\r\n. . . . . . .\r\n\r\nFeedback about this scent:\r\n\r\n&quot;I am SO pleased with this perfume. I LOVE certain smoke fragrances that remind me of actual types of wood being burned in a campfire, but others are just soot to me. This has a good smoke scent, beautifully bolstered by the pine, so you really feel like you have the scent of the campfire in the forest, not just a burn-barrel, wrapped around you. The whiskey adds a solid masculine note...this is all-around great !!&quot;",

"policy_payment": "All sales from this shop are done through PayPal or credit card. Your order will not ship until after payment is processed.",
"policy_shipping": "Orders will ship within 2-4 business days of purchase. The Madame ships everything via the US Postal Service. They know her, they love her. They snicker at her beard.\r\n\r\nShipping Overage Refunds for Domestic and International Orders:\r\nIf your shipping price seems way too high, don&#39;t be alarmed. Madame will refund you for any significant overages.",
"policy_refunds": "Generally, all sales are final. There are no refunds or exchanges. If you attempt to return an item that has been used (even slightly), you will not receive a refund.\r\n\r\nIf for some reason you are truly disappointed in your order, don&#39;t hesitate to contact the Madame to discuss your options, and please do so before leaving feedback.\r\n\r\nMadame does not refund shipping fees.",
"policy_additional": "A Note About Solid Perfumes:\r\nThe Madame&#39;s solids will last you a long time. Store at room temperature and remember that the main ingredient is WAX: if left in your car on a hot summer day, be aware that it will melt, so please use caution when opening the tin. (Fragrance will return to it&#39;s solid state once cooled.)\r\n\r\nHow To Use Solid Perfumes:\r\nSimply rub your finger over the surface of the perfume, and then apply to any area of the body, preferably pulse points (your body heat will strengthen the scent). Solid perfumes are for external use only. DO NOT use as lip balm, or on sensitive areas.\r\n\r\nAllergies:\r\nRead all ingredients carefully before ordering, please - especially if you have known allergies to certain fragrances. Please contact the Madame if you have any questions or concerns. She is generally very quick at replying.\r\n\r\nWholesale:\r\nMost items are available for wholesale, and custom orders are welcome. Don&#39;t be afraid to ask! However, we will not do consignment and we will not ship our products to you without labels. It&#39;s the beard or nothing, baby.\r\nIf you are inquiring about a wholesale order, please provide the following info:\r\n– Your shop name and physical location.\r\n– Website if possible, or any social media links to your business.\r\n– Images of your shop (this is very important, as we want to ensure that we will be a good fit in your space).\r\n– A list of the products you are interested in carrying.\r\n\r\nInternational Orders:\r\nPlease note that packages can be delayed in customs for a number of reasons, and on rare occasion you may have to pay an additional fee to claim your package. We apologize that we have no control over this situation. Also please know your country&#39;s guidelines and restrictions for international packages. The most typical reason for packages held in customs is that an item contained within is prohibited by that country.\r\n\r\nFeedback:\r\nWe are perfectionists and we are pleasers. We receive very little negative feedback, and of course we&#39;d like to keep it that way! We understand that you may not like the scent you ordered – everyone&#39;s nose experiences scents differently. Before leaving any harsh feedback, please do consider other aspects of your experience here. We are quite proud of our customer service and speedy shipping. We work hard to deliver a positive experience with every order. xo",

"description": "40th Birthday Shirt - Aged to Perfection - Born in 1974\r\n\r\nJust like a fine whiskey you get better with age. This whiskey inspired 40th Birthday t-shirt is a great way to show off your &quot;Aged Perfection&quot;. Makes a great gift as well.\r\n\r\nThis funny tshirt is printed on your choice of ultra cotton shirt color with soft water based white ink. The shirt is printed using a method known as discharge printing. The white ink actually replaces the shirts dye leaving an incredibly soft shirt where the print has no feel after it&#39;s first wash!  These are real quality t-shirts, printed on UPGRADED 6.1 ounce, Gildan ultra cotton Tees. No thin off brand t-shirts here!\r\n\r\nSizing\r\nSmall: Width 18&quot; - Length 28&quot; - Sleeve Length 16.5&quot;\r\nMedium: Width 20&quot; - Length 29&quot; - Sleeve Length 18&quot;\r\nLarge: Width 22&quot; - Length 30&quot; - Sleeve Length 19.5&quot;\r\nXLarge: Width 24&quot; - Length 31&quot; - Sleeve Length 21&quot;\r\n2XLarge: Width 26&quot; - Length 32&quot; - Sleeve Length 22.5&quot;\r\n3XLarge: Width 28&quot; - Length 33&quot; - Sleeve Length 24&quot;\r\n4XLarge: Width 30&quot; - Length 34&quot; - Sleeve Length 25.25&quot;",

"description": "Customize your Mini Liquor Bottles! These make perfect wedding, birthday, or party favors! This item can be ordered with the labels only or with the labels and empty bottles. Want this customized for a different occasion or in a different way? Just contact us and we would be happy to create a custom listing for you.\r\n\r\nFeel free to give us a call with any questions (888) 959-2870 M-F 9am - 5pm Central or send us a convo anytime!\r\n\r\nIF YOU CHOOSE THE LABELS ONLY OPTION:\r\n- Custom labels only - Mini bottles not included\r\n- The Labels are approximately 3&quot; wide x 1 7/8&quot; high. \r\n- Designed to fit Jack Daniels, Captain Morgan, Smirnoff, Jim Beam, and Southern Comfort. \r\n- These labels are printed on high quality vinyl and cut to fit over the original label. The vinyl labels have an adhesive back like a sticker. \r\n- Please compare these dimensions to your liquor bottle labels because bottles and labels may vary. \r\n- You should be able to purchase the mini bottles in bulk from your local liquor store.\r\n\r\nIF YOU CHOOSE THE LABELS AND EMPTY BOTTLES OPTION:\r\n- Custom 50 mL mini liquor bottle labels AND empty bottles. \r\n- The empty bottles are ROUND, not square.\r\n- This is for the labels and bottles only...liquor not included. \r\n- This kit is designed so that you can buy a large bottle of your favorite liquor or mix your own cocktail and use the included funnel to fill the empty mini bottles. Then just screw the included caps on the bottles, and apply the labels. No adhesive or glue required...just peel and apply like a sticker. This DIY option saves you money so you do not have to source mini bottles in bulk. \r\n- This DIY favor kit includes the following: Custom Labels, Empty 50 mL Plastic Bottles, Black Bottle Caps, Funnel\r\n\r\nTO ORDER:\r\nPlease send us the following information:\r\n- Custom Text for the Front\r\n- Bride&#39;s First Name\r\n- Date\r\n- Location\r\n- Color Choice\r\n\r\nOur labels are printed on high quality vinyl. The material we use is similar to that used to wrap race cars, billboards, and bumper stickers. The vinyl gives a smooth, waterproof finish second to none! Quality is our top priority and we wanted our products to be the best, which is why we&#39;ve taken our design to this level. The colors displayed on your monitor may be slightly different from the actual label.\r\n\r\nWHOLESALE INQUIRIES:\r\nLiquid Courage products are available in select boutiques throughout multiple countries. If you are interested in carrying our line in your retail space, please contact us for details.\r\n\r\nKEEP SHOPPING:\r\nhttp://www.etsy.com/shop/LiquidCourage\r\nhttp://liquidcourageflasks.com\r\n\r\nVINETTA MAE:\r\nBe sure to check out our other Etsy shop, Vinetta Mae!

"policy_welcome": "Hello and welcome to our shop! My name is Amy, and my husband, Tyler and I are the owners and creators of Liquid Courage. We have been selling online since 2003. Recently, we decided to make the leap from selling items made by others to selling items that we make. We have been goofing around making all sorts of arts, crafts, scrapbooks, and clothing for many years and decided to combine my hobby with my online business experience. \r\n\r\nTyler has an Accounting degree from Tennessee Technological University, and I have a bachelor&#39;s degree in Marketing and an MBA in Accounting from TTU as well.  Upon graduating, we tried &quot;real, grown-up jobs&quot; - Tyler as a general manager at a greenhouse manufacturing company, and I as a staff accountant for a nationwide manufacturing company.  We spent a couple of years working for &quot;the man&quot;...at a desk eight hours a day...fifty weeks a year.\r\n\r\nWe finally decided to follow our dream of becoming entrepreneurs, pursue our passion, and determine our own future with hands on approach. We chose the path less traveled by, and that has made all the difference.\r\n\r\nPlease don&#39;t hesitate to ask if you have any questions or would like a custom item.\r\n\r\n(888) 959-2870 (M-F 9am - 5pm Eastern)\r\nor\r\nConvo us anytime! \r\n\r\nCheers! \r\nTyler and Amy",
